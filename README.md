### Pricing

All listed CI's provide free plan with some restrictions like "open-source projects only" or "only 1 build node",
but it's enough to configure the build process and check if CI suits or not.

##### Free plans

Choosing a free plan for a project is more suitable for a freelance project.
Usually, some services provide limits on such plans for understandable reasons.

##### Paid plans

CI's have different approaches and different paid plans.
Check every CI pricing information for more details and choose the best option for you.

:warning: *This information can get outdated very quickly as services evolve.* :warning:

### Checkstyle

Project uses custom Checkstyle [rules](https://github.com/vgaidarji/ci-matters/blob/master/app/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml).

### Fabric/Crashlytics project configuration

In order to upload APK to Crashlytics project should have following configuration:
`${projectDir}/fabric.properties` file with `apiSecret` and `io.fabric.ApiKey` in AndroidManifest.xml([1](https://github.com/vgaidarji/ci-matters/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L17),
[2](https://github.com/vgaidarji/ci-matters/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L59)) file.
**Both keys should not be uploaded to the repository for security reasons!**

Pass both parameters to your build from command line:

    ./gradlew -PfabricApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY" -PfabricApiSecret="YOUR_API_SECRET" crashlyticsUploadDistributionDebug

or export these keys as environment variables on a build machine
and they will be automatically read from there during the build (no need to pass keys as parameters in this case).

### Coveralls

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/vgaidarji/ci-matters/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/vgaidarji/ci-matters)

`Coveralls` provides test coverage information. `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` environment variable should be exported on the build machine.
